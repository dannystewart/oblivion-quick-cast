# Quick Cast Hotkeys for Oblivion Remastered

This is a mod of a mod for Oblivion Remastered by [Nistaux](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/users/21571864) on [Nexus Mods](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/1531).

I was experiencing an issue that others don't seem to be having based on the mod posts where a race condition when pressing a number key caused the previous spell to on the first press instead of the intended one, as it hadn't finished switching quickly enough. This attempts to address that.

To install, you need [UE4SS](https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/32), and the mod should go here: `OblivionRemastered\Binaries\Win64\ue4ss\Mods\QuickCast\Scripts\main.lua`
